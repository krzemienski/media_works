# Media Works Shell Scripts
Some simple scripts to convert, normilaze, transcode media files

"normnconv" - normalize audio/music during conversion it to *.ogg 
  
"nvenc2mp4" - nvidia hardware accelerated video transcoding script mkv, webm, flv, ts, avi to mp4

"fdrc" - (force dynamic range compression) makes the sound of video files in the format *.mkv or *.mp4 louder, but not an  equivalent to sources, so it suitable for movies and cartoons, but not for concerts and music
