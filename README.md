# Media Works Shell Scripts
Some simple scripts to convert, normilaze, transcode media files


"normnconv" - normalize audio/music during conversion it to *.ogg 
  
"videotranscode" - transcode mkv, webm, flv, ts, avi to format (mp4) compatible with my TV
  
"fdrc" - (force dynamic range compression) makes the sound of video files in the format *.mkv or *.mp4 louder, but not an  equivalent to sources, so it suitable for movies and cartoons, but not for concerts and music
