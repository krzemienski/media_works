# Media Works Shell Scripts

"normnconv" - normalize audio/music during convert it to *.ogg 
  
"nvenc2mp4" - nvidia hardware accelerated video transcoding script mkv, webm, flv, ts, avi to mp4

"fdrc" - (force dynamic range compression) makes the sound of video files in the format *.mkv or *.mp4 louder, but not an  equivalent to sources, so it suitable for movies and cartoons, but not for concerts and music.

"f2fn" ~~(fvn)~~ - normalize and recompress flac to flac, equivalent but louder if possible.

"tempo" - Sometimes I'd like to listen a music with a little faster speed. This script allow me to do it without any dependency from any music player.
